<p>Just previous to the disastrous events which I am about to relate,
Bearcat Gibson and me was the happiest cowboys this side of Denver. Old
Lady Luck had patted us on the back and filled our pockets. The trail
ahead was glitterin’ bright with the promise of more to come. After a
long spell of hard luck, we finally stood on our own feet, lookin’ old
man Trouble in the eye and daring him to do his worst.</p>

<p>After a great deal of planning and schemin’ we had managed to sneak
up on the rest of the boys and win most all the money offered for prizes
at the Eldora rodeo. This in itself was reason enough to cause great
rejoicing, but on the last day of the Eldora show we had received a
message from our old pal Clay Hinkle, bearing news of a very important
and joyous nature. The letter read as follows:</p>

<quote>
<p rend='ni'>Dere boys:</p>

<p>Well, you ok horsethieves, I thot I wood rite you a few lines to let

<p>I beg to remain as ever yores sincarly and Korjaly yores.</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>Of course we aimed to make the San Dominick stampede anyhow, but like
Clay wrote, the competition was always very keen at that show on account
it caught all the top hands on their way to the Eastern contests. Even
after parting with half our winnings, we stood to collect a flock of
money which wasn’t to be sneezed at.</p>

<p>We cashed the checks donated to us by the Eldora rodeo committee and
proceeded to stage a celebration befitting the occasion, before getting
under way for San Dominick.</p>

<p>But as luck would have it, the natives mistook our friendly ceremony
for an effort on our part to destroy and plunder their moral community.
Trouble came on the heels of this unfounded suspicion, and we was called
upon to surrender and be led peaceful from the scene.</p>

<p>The marshal who made the suggestion was a big, tall, nervous-looking
<foreign>hombre</foreign> with a diving Adam’s apple and a large flowing
pinto mustache. The only weapon he carried—that we could see, anyway--was
a big crooked cane. And we wasn’t to be overawed by any such ineffective
display of force.</p>

<p><quote>Listen, Wild Bill,</quote> said Bearcat to the marshal.
<quote>As much as we ’preciate your kind offer, and not wishin’ to cast
any asparagus at your jail, we been in better ones and could not
possibly be interested in visitin’ yours.</quote></p>

<p>A crowd had collected around us. Election-time was drawin’ near, and
the marshal had to protect his reputation. His Adam’s apple made a few
rapid trips from his chin to his belt-buckle and back again; the spotted
misplaced horse’s tail bristled like a bunch of quills; he elevated the
crooked cane and charged us in the scientific fashion of a blind
bull.</p>

<p><quote>Whoo--ah!</quote> said the marshal, snorting and pawing at the
air like a bear with a wasp up his nose. But immediate developments
disclosed the surprising fact that getting hit with a cane wasn’t a
thing which we considered a privilege.</p>

<p>Bearcat and me stepped aside and allowed the marshal to get between
us. Then Bearcat placed a boot-heel in the seat of his pants and pushed
hard. The marshal’s gasping form shot across the sidewalk like a flying
comet and plowed its way through a plate-glass window which protected a
display of elegant female lingerie.</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>The old walrus began makin’ frantic swimmin’ motions,
wallowin’ in a sea of broken glass and silk negligees. Puffing like a
wind-broke horse and clutching madly for support, he pulled down whole
rows of pink stockin’s and bright-colored, beflowered shawls and
kimonos. Two wax dummies with Fourth-of-July complexions and adorned in
glitterin’ Paris creations came tumblin’ down on top of him, addin’ to
the final touch of destruction.</p>

<p><quote>Whoo--ah!</quote> screamed the marshal from under the smiling
dummies. <quote>Just wait till I git my hands on ye!</quote></p>

<p>We was willing to wait. We couldn’t got away had we wanted to.
Holding our shaking sides with both hands, we howled like a pair of
treed panthers. This was too gosh-awful funny for words. Tears running
from our eyes, we failed to notice the approach of a new and
unlooked-for enemy, which turned out to be far more dangerous than the
befuddled marshal.</p>

<p>The first I knew of it was when something heavy crashed on top of my
head, which was luckily protected by my big  I sat down on the
sidewalk and rolled to the side, lookin’ up to see who was attackin’ me.
I beheld a large, powerful female belaborin’ Bearcat with what looked to
me like a bare human leg cut off above the knee. Not considering it safe
to remain gazing at this strange, grisly spectacle, I regained a
standing posture and took out from there like a wild colt with his tail
on fire.</p>

<p>On the edge of town I was passed by a flyin’ shadow which I
recognized as Bearcat Gibson. I glanced fearfully back over my shoulder
and saw a big mob of people hot on our trail. The marshal led the chase,
waving a big old pistol he had produced from somewhere, and scattering
silk doodads in his wake. Right on his heels Battling Mary followed,
brandishing the human leg and uttering blood-curdling yells. In another
half-second I had caught up with Bearcat.</p>

<p>We was leavin’ Eldora, havin’ become awful tired and disgusted with
that particular metropolis.</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>A mile farther and still goin’ strong, we caught up with a
dilapidated flivver which was fluttering between the fences at the speed
of a limping turtle. Two men dressed in greasy unionalls sat in the
front seat, fiddling with numerous buttons and levers which seemed to
have bearin’ on the exhausted engine under the hood.</p>

<p><quote>Hop in, boys!</quote> said the driver. <quote>You might beat
us on a short spurt, but you’ll get farther with old Lili.</quote></p>

<p>We agreed with him on that, as we was beginning to falter in our
stride. We scrambled inside the car, which seemed to grunt and squeak in
protest at the added weight. Our pursuers had not yet appeared over the
last hill, and we sank down on the back seat, feeling very kindly toward
the men which had surely rescued us from a terrible fate.</p>

<p><quote>Lord! Knockin’ folks around with human legs!</quote> said I,
shuddering at the thought. <quote>Can you imagine anything so
crool?</quote></p>

<p><quote>It wasn’t no human leg,</quote> put in Bearcat. <quote>It was
one of them there artificial things they display stockings on, in
stores. The woman was the owner of the layout spoilt by the marshal.
They should watch that woman. She’ll murder somebody one of these days.
I swear I never see such a mad person!</quote> Bearcat rubbed various
parts of his anatomy, very careful.</p>

<p><quote>Where you boys goin’?</quote> grinned one of the men in the
front seat.</p>

<p><quote>We aint so much goin’ anywheres,</quote> I answered.
<quote>We’re just leavin’ Eldora.</quote></p>

<p><quote>Well, we’ll have to let you out pretty soon. We aint goin’
far,</quote> continued the man.</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>Disaster was starin’ us in the face, and despair settled upon us. We
knew them mad natives wouldn’t give up the chase so easy. Most likely
they’d have reward-posters out before morning. Dead or alive!</p>

<p>The little car had come to a stop in front of a gate opening into a
large pasture. In the pasture we saw an airyplane setting on the
ground.</p>

<p><quote>As far as we go!</quote> said the man, gettin’ out of the car
to open the gate. <quote>That’s our crate in there.</quote></p>

<p>The other fellow turned around and looked us over.</p>

<p><quote>Don’t want to take a ride in the old lady, do you,
boys?</quote> he said anxious-like. <quote>The thrill of a lifetime, and
safer than old Lili, here. Three dollars only for fifteen minutes of
exhilarating flying through the ether!</quote></p>

<p>I have a suspicion we could of went for a dollar and a half. You
could tell at a glance that prosperity had deserted them particular
aviators at the last crossroads. But as much as I desired to leave these
parts, I did not crave any flying experiences. It was too much like
jumping from the skillet into the stove.</p>

<p>But my crazy partner right away shut both eyes and jumped astraddle
of the idea with all the enthusiasm of a roving preacher for a repenting
sinner.</p>

<p><quote>Shore!</quote> he whispered, nudging me in the ribs. <quote>We
could get them fellows to take us to San Dominick, where a rodeo is to
be put on in a few days. Boy, we’re shore lucky!</quote> Then, without
waitin’ for me to say a word, he assumed the important and worried
expression of a man who has just bought a string of oil-wells and has
only a few minutes to reach a radio in order to accept the
nomination.</p>

<p><quote>We’d like to go to San Dominick,</quote> he said to the
aviator. <quote>And we’d like to leave fairly soon.</quote></p>

<p>The aviator’s knees kinda buckled under him. All he could do for a
spell was to look at us with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p><quote>Do you mean it?</quote> he asked. <quote>Boys, please don’t
kid a poor old man!</quote></p>

<p><quote>Shore we mean it,</quote> answered Bearcat. <quote>If the
price is right.</quote></p>

<p><quote>The price couldn’t be anything but right,</quote> said the
aviator. <quote>A few twists here and there, and we’re goin’ from here,
gentlemen.</quote></p>

<p><quote>Hey!</quote> I put in, alarmed at the way things were coming
out. <quote>Who said I wanted to fly? I’m askin’ you. Did I ever express
the slightest wish to do so? Did I, eh?</quote></p>

<p>The aviator cast a murderous and poisonous look upon me. Words
dropped from his mouth like sweet drops of strychnine.</p>

<p><quote>Oh, come, now!</quote> he said, trying to be pleasant.
<quote>There’s no danger, you know. Surely a brave cowboy like you is
not afraid of a little spin in the air!</quote></p>

<p><quote>I might be brave,</quote> said I. <quote>And I might be a
cowboy. But,</quote>--and I pronounced every word clear and
loud,--<quote>I wouldn’t care to take any spins in the air!</quote></p>

<p><quote>Never mind him,</quote> put in Bearcat. <quote>He’s only
foolin’. He just dotes on airyplanes and aviators and things like t
Why, that fellow is the original aviation fan!</quote></p>

<p>Cleanin’ me! Can you beat that--or tie it, even? I was struck
dumb.</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>The flivver went bouncing across the pasture and stopped alongside
the airyplane. The aviators got out and started screwing up loose
connections.</p>

<p><quote>It’s no use, Bearcat,</quote> I stated very firm. <quote>I
have no taste for aviation.</quote> I’d heard about people riding in
airyplanes, but I wasn’t sufficiently informed on the subject to enter
into discussion of it. Furthermore, I’d just as soon it hadn’t been
brought to my attention.</p>

<p>But Bearcat was a stubborn cuss and gifted with the power of
persuasion. There wasn’t nothing he didn’t know about the safety devices
used in modern aviation. For instance: out of 15,347 flights launched in
the State of Maryland alone, in one year, fourteen only had been fatal.
Which to his way of thinkin’ was a very low rate. Accordin’ to my
opinion, fourteen dead men was fourteen dead men, even if everybody in
Maryland had all gone crazy and took to leaping around in the air like a
bunch of whizzing pelicans.</p>

<p><quote>Here!</quote> said Bearcat. <quote>While the man is tyin’ a
few of the vital parts together with hay-wire, I will explain the
fundamental principles to you. This,</quote> he declaimed, pointing to a
couple of oars, <quote>this is the paddle. It paddles the wings.
This,</quote> he continued, indicating a growth on the tail end,
<quote>this takes the place of the tailfeathers on a bird.</quote></p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>But I wasn’t to be misled so easy; and anyway, if Bearcat knew the
difference between a doughnut-cutter and a two-dollar bill, he had never
showed any signs of it to me. Besides, I have an eye for details, and he
can’t make me believe that a good Number One airyplane should have rusty
spots on it and be punched full of holes. When a Ford leaks oil, there’s
something wrong with it. Well, that thing leaked oil. And the longer I
inspected the wreck of old 97, the more I was reminded of a busted kite
which had been drug through a prickly-pear thicket.</p>

<p>Just then I overheard part of the conversation between the
aviators.</p>

<p><quote>You give me a hand gettin’ started,</quote> said one.
<quote>Then you can take our stuff to San Dominick in the
car.</quote></p>

<p><quote>Got enough gas for this flight?</quote> asked the other.</p>

<p><quote>Well, I wouldn’t be too sure, but I think there’s
enough.</quote></p>

<p><emph>He thought there was enough!</emph> Well sir, right then is
when I made up my mind to take a airyplane trip. If that bleary-eyed
fool was willin’ to run out of gas while flyin’ through the ether, I was
too!</p>

<p>I noticed Bearcat had bleached out some. <quote>Did you hear
that?</quote> he whispered.</p>

<figure rend="center70">
  <graphic url="images/illus-001.png"/>
  <head>I glanced fearfully back over my shoulder. The marshal led the chase; right on his heels Battling Mary followed, brandishing her human leg.</head>
  <figDesc>A lady running toward a crashed biplane</figDesc>
</figure>

<p><quote>Shore!</quote> says I. <quote>Did you know that out of
twenty-six fatal airyplane wrecks in Arkansaw alone, twenty-five was
caused from runnin’ out of gas? But shucks, there aint nothing to worry
about. The gadget paddles the wings and the pin-feathers do the rest.
Nothing to it!</quote></p>

<p><quote>Hum!</quote> growls Bearcat lookin’ suspicious.
<quote>Hum!</quote></p>

<p>About then the experts had decided everything was O.K., and they got
ready to start her up. Me and Bearcat moved to a safe location where we
could watch, and the pilot clumb in and fiddled around with various
gimmicks. The other bird stood by the paddle.</p>

<p><quote>Contact!</quote> he yells--just like t</p>

<p><quote>Contact!</quote> growls the other fellow in a deep tone of
voice. Then the <foreign>hombre</foreign> outside puts on a dance, the
likes of which I have never witnessed before, not even durin’ my stay
with the Osages. He grabs one end of the paddle, throws one leg up in
the graceful fashion of a toe-dancer, swings and shivers a couple of
times and jerks down on it.</p>

<p>Nothing happens. I felt sorry for him. You could tell he was
disappointed. Something big should have come of it.</p>

<p>He looks up pitiful-like and yelps again: <quote>Contact!</quote></p>

<p><quote>Contact!</quote> rumbles the pilot, and on with the dance. The
fellow goes through every single motion again. You could tell it was a
question of great importance not to miss anything. He pounces down on
that paddle like a hungry coyote on a gopher. And then--hell busts
loose!</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>My hat is jerked off my head like it had been shot off,
and my shirt casts loose from its moorings and flies up in my face,
blinding me complete. I falls over backward, clutching wildly for
support. I feels a form wriggling under me. <quote>Get off’n me, you
idjit!</quote> yelps a faint voice through the roar and thunder of the
cyclone and hailstorm raging around us. <quote>Get off from under
me,</quote> I replies, peeved. <quote>I saw that hole first!</quote></p>

<p>I managed to pull the shirt off my face and took a quick look around.
Well, could you believe it? There wasn’t no cyclone. Everything was fine
and serene as before, only the old paddle had gone wild, and the tin
whipporwill was shakin’ fearsome, and roaring like four hundred mad
bulls in a tunnel. The aviator was waving for us to get on. Holding our
hats against our ears, we circled the old butter-tub on the run and
approached it from the rear. I dumb in a hole in front of the pilot, and
Bearcat settled himself in another hole in front of me.</p>

<p>All at once the roaring increased--although I wouldn’t of thought it
possible--and we started bumping across the field. Faster and faster we
lunged along until the air was slapping me in the face like a wet
saddle-blanket.</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>Ever since a safe fell on me when I was little, I have been given to
imagining wrecks and catastrophes. I didn’t need to stretch my
imagination now. First I got to thinkin’ what would happen if we come
across a big ditch, or a rock, or a cow or other objects too ghastly to
dwell upon. Then I looked down, and there it was--a fresh-plowed field
which looked rougher to me than a chain of mountains.... Lord, Lord,
thinks I, this is no place for old Slocum Bill. I still have a chance to
get away from this hell-bending Roman candle, and I aims to take it. I
starts to climb off, whatever comes of it. I am accustomed to fallin’
and rollin’ on the ground. I know how to relax and protect myself. But
all them fine principles don’t apply to a smashed-up orange crate with
wings. Now is the time for me and 97 to separate, for better or for
worse.</p>

<p>I am about half out when I feels a hand on my shoulder. I takes a
look and sees the pilot smiling, and then I makes a startling discovery.
We had left old Mother Earth and I was about to fling myself through a
hundred feet of empty air and not a hand-holt in sight! What’s more, I
caught a glimpse of a big car tearing down the road toward us, and in it
was the marshal and Battling Mary and several other warlike-looking
parties.</p>

<p>I settled back in my seat and watches the plowed field shrink to the
size of a handkerchief. Well, here we are--it’s too late to do anything
now! I have one happy thought, and that’s what I will do to Bearcat
Gibson for getting me into such a predicament. We fly on and on through
the exhilarating ether, gasping for breath and watching the scenery from
where no scenery should be seen.</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>After about ten minutes my sensible ears began to tell me there was
something rotten somewhere not connected with the state of Denmark. I
don’t know if an airyplane in good working order is supposed to sputter,
but this one was sputtering, and I didn’t like it. Bearcat looked back
at me, and his bogged-out eyes did not indicate a peaceful state of
mind, either. I craned my neck around, and while I was doing so the
sputtering changed to coughing, and the coughing died out, and our pilot
said so we both could hear it: <quote>Outa gas ... Hold tight ... I’ll
land ’er ... No trouble.</quote></p>

<p>Can you imagine a ring-tailed son-of-a-gun like that one? No trouble!
Oh, no, no trouble at all! Maybe he thought us being in front, we would
kinda break the fall for him. He began circling his busted skyrocket in
wide loops, and the first thing I knew we was skimming trees and
housetops.</p>

<p>The trouble was the fields in that country was too small, and there
was too many obstacles in the way, and we was goin’ too fast to let a
little thing like a greenhouse stop us. The only indication we had of
goin’ through that greenhouse was a merry tinkle of broken glass and a
whiff of flowers in bloom. Two big red geraniums fanned my cheeks; a
bunch of gladiolas settled in my streamin’ hair: and my lap was suddenly
piled high with an assortment of posies and ferns.</p>

<p>On, like a wild bounding antelope we went, over a clover-field,
bouncing over a culvert, across a road, into a cemetery, sowin’ flowers
and airyplane parts over the graves, merrily knockin’ down tombstones
and monuments right and left.</p>

<p>The thrill of a lifetime? Well, I hope to tell you!</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>Once I thought I lost an eye in an apple orchard, but it wasn’t
knocked out for good. It got all right in a couple of months. We also
visited a watermelon patch, but soon left it behind after a good deal of
crunching, and uprootin’ of trailin’ vines.</p>

<p>Bumping across a terrorized countryside at the speed of a comet, we
met head-on with a herd of geese, and their goslings trooping innocently
behind. A large cloud of feathers arose and was gone. A big red barn
took a wing from us; a henhouse got the other. The paddle had busted in
ten thousand splinters when crossin’ the cornfield.</p>

<p>A creek loomed ahead, but it was a shallow one, and we forded it
successfully. Had it not been for the opposite bank, which rose straight
in the air, there is no tellin’ how much farther we would have roamed,
scattering death and destruction in our wake. But even that go-devil of
an outfit couldn’t get the best of a bank composed mostly of large
rocks. There was a terrible crash; then the peaceful silence of an
afternoon in the country.</p>

<p>I don’t recollect much after that, only it seemed that I had a
wonderful dream in which I lived over some of the past happenings.
Bearcat floated through the air by my side. There was a ring of light
around his big hat, and he flopped around with the help of a pair of
wings. His open mouth was relaxed in the loving smile of an angel, and a
large floral wreath bearing the golden inscription <hi><quote>Rest in
Peace</quote></hi> hung about his shoulders. You could just imagine the
mourners, heads bowed in sorrow, and the soft, mellow notes of an organ
playing, “Here comes the bride--”</p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>I could have remained in that position for hours,
thinking beautiful thoughts. Our breathless dash across the country was
something to look back on and write home about--the informal visit in the
greenhouse, the evening scamper across the cemetery, the good-natured
pushin’ over of tombstones, the playful manner in which we
had destroyed orchards, cornfields and barnyard fowls;
I’ll tell you, it was something to quicken a man’s breath and make his
eyes sparkle!</p>

<p>Then a harsh note tore me from this dream--several harsh notes, to be
exact. I opened one eye--and then I shut it again very sudden.</p>

<p>The dream had changed now to a nightmare. Loud, grinding voices
argued back and forth. I pinched myself to make sure I was awake....</p>

<p>I lay in a bed, a nice clean white bed. The well-known hospital smell
was in the air. Cautiously, I opened the eye again to make sure I’d seen
right the first time.</p>

<p>A group of excited people stood by my bed. Two of the figures I
recognized only too well. One was tall and had a long flowing spotted
mustache. The other had black skirts and a terrible disposition. Old
Walrus and Battling Mary!</p>

<p><quote>Yes indeed, it’s them!</quote> screamed Mary. <quote>Don’t I
know the scoundrels? Didn’t I see them destroy hundreds of dollars’
worth of merchandise for me? Will I, or will I not, get
justice?</quote></p>

<p><quote>Be calm, madam, be calm!</quote> said a soothing voice.
<quote>They are in no shape to be questioned now. They have some money
which we have deposited in our safe. We feel sure it will more than
cover your claims--</quote></p>

<milestone rend="stars"/>

<p>The group moved from the bed, and I took a look around. Bearcat was
stretched out in another cot, close by. Unconsciousness had give him a
look of almost human intelligence.</p>

<p>Our good bronk-ridin’ money to go for ruint lingerie!</p>

<p>Just then I saw old Walrus glarin’ at me. His Adam’s apple was
travelin’ at a terrific rate of speed. Gosh, that man was mad! I
remembered him wallowin’ under the dummies and all the silk
what-nots--and I covered up my head, and the white sheet began to shake,
quiver and roll.</p>

<p>A nurse run out and pulled the covers from my tearful face. She was a
stunning-looking girl!</p>

<p>She patted my pillow, a smile on her lips. Oh, well, maybe things
wasn’t as bad as they looked.</p>

<p><quote>You’re a funny one,</quote> said the nurse. <quote>Unconscious
one minute, laughing fit to be tied the next. You cowboys are strange
fellows.</quote></p>

<p><quote>Lady,</quote> said I, <quote>you don’t know the half of
it!</quote></p>
