## About This Book

When two down-on-their-luck cowboys strike gold at a rodeo and receive a
crooked judge's invitation to split prize money, their celebration lands
them in hot water with the law. Fleeing an angry mob—led by a marshal
wielding a pistol and a vengeful shopkeeper brandishing a mannequin
leg—they hitch a ride that turns into their most dangerous adventure
yet: a flight in a questionable airplane with dubious fuel reserves. A
wild, humorous tale of Old West mischief colliding with early aviation.
